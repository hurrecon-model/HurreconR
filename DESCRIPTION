Description: The HURRECON model estimates wind speed, wind direction, enhanced 
    Fujita scale wind damage, and duration of EF0 to EF5 winds as a function 
    of hurricane location and maximum sustained wind speed. Results may be 
    generated for a single site or an entire region. Hurricane track and 
    intensity data may be imported directly from the US National Hurricane 
    Center's HURDAT2 database.
